# android-http-app

<h2>Uses <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/volley/simple">Volly</a></h2>

<p>This was developed using Android Studio</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://github.com/JSON-G/android-http-server">android-http-server</a> for the app to communicate with the server.</p>

<p>`10.0.2.2` is used as access to server locally (localhost) because this app is tested on a virtual android machine native to Android Studio.</p> 

<p>So the setup is basically: Node server is running on port 3000 and the app is running on a virtual android machine accessing 10.0.2.2 as endpoints</p>
