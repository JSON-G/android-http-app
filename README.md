# android-http-app

<h2>Uses [Volly](https://developer.android.com/training/volley/simple)</h2>

<p>Use `android-http-server` for the app to communicate with the server
`10.0.2.2` is used as access to server locally (localhost) because this app is tested on a virtual android machine native to Android Studio.</p> 

<p>So the setup is basically: Node server is running on port 3000 and the app is running on a virtual android machine accessing 10.0.2.2 as endpoints</p>
