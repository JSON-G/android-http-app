# android-http-app
Uses [Volly](https://developer.android.com/training/volley/simple)

Use `android-http-server` for the app to communicate with the server
`10.0.2.2` is used as access to server locally (localhost) because this app is tested on a virtual android machine native to Android Studio. So the setup is basically: Node server is running on port 3000 and the app is running on a virtual android machine accessing 10.0.2.2 as endpoints
